Identify which drugs have been tested and create a set for each. \n2. Return multiple sets if more than drug is present in the text.\nFor each drug:\n3. Get direct target: Use the following logic: if the text clearly and directly mentions that the drug targets a gene and has also defined the type of interaction\n4. Get interaction type between the drug and direct target: if explicitly and clearly mentioned, then get the drug-direct target relationship type. What does the drug do to the direct target? inhibitor, activator, etc.?\n5. Get groups tested: specify which type of genes was the drug tested on, eg. if drug was tested on samples showing high expression of certain gene.\n6. Collect all disease names for which the drug has been tested into 1 list.\n7. Extract any specific ClinicalTrials.gov identifier or number.\n8. For each drug, construct a set consisting of (drug name, direct target, drug-direct target interaction, tested or effective group, ClinicalTrials.gov number, all diseases that the drug is tested in)\n9. Any empty values should be indicated by null and not an empty string.\n10. Double check your logic and see if the data you have collected is actually reflected in the text. If not, make revisions.\n11. Both, direct target, and drug-direct target interaction fields should have been filled or both should be null. Only one of these fields cannot be null.\n12. Assemble all sets and produce 1 final JSON output in a single line without any whitespaces.\n***\n### EXAMPLES\nPMID23:LKB1/STK11 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a major role in controlling cell metabolism, resulting in potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in LKB1-mutant cancers. Here, we identify the NAD + degrading ectoenzyme, CD38, as a new target in LKB1-mutant NSCLC. Metabolic profiling of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) revealed that LKB1 mutant lung cancers have a striking increase in ADP-ribose, a breakdown product of the critical redox co-factor, NAD + . Surprisingly, compared with other genetic subsets, murine and human LKB1-mutant NSCLC show marked overexpression of the NAD+-catabolizing ectoenzyme, CD38 on the surface of tumor cells. Loss of LKB1 or inactivation of Salt-Inducible Kinases (SIKs)-key downstream effectors of LKB1- induces CD38 transcription induction via a CREB binding site in the CD38 promoter. Treatment with the FDA-approved anti-CD38 antibody, daratumumab, inhibited growth of LKB1-mutant NSCLC xenografts. Together, these results reveal CD38 as a promising therapeutic target in patients with LKB1 mutant lung cancer.\nOutput:{\"PMID23\": [{\"drug name\": \"daratumumab\",\"target\": [{\"direct target\": \"CD38\",\"drug-direct target interaction\": \"anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody\"},],\"tested or effective group\": [\"LKB-1/STK-11 mutant NSCLC\"],\"drug tested in following diseases\": [\"lung cancer\", \"NSCLC\"],\"ClinicalTrials.gov ID\": []}]}\n###\nTASKS:\nUse the RULES and EXAMPLES and create a similar outputs for the following text delimited by ID:\n"}
