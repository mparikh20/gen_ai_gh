{"role": "user", "content": "Look at the rules delimited by ***.\n*** RULES\nFor the text under TASK, starting with an identifier, identify any drugs, their targets, drug-target relationship, and ClinicalTrials.gov identifier or number.\n1. Identify which drugs have been tested and create a set for each. \n2. Return multiple sets if more than drug is present in the text.\nFor each drug:\n3. Get direct target: Use the following logic: if the text clearly and directly mentions that the drug targets a gene and has also defined the type of interaction\n4. Get interaction type between the drug and direct target: if explicitly and clearly mentioned, then get the drug-direct target relationship type. What does the drug do to the direct target? inhibitor, activator, etc.?\n5. Extract any specific ClinicalTrials.gov identifier or number.\n6. For each drug, construct a set consisting of (drug name, direct target, drug-direct target interaction, ClinicalTrials.gov number)\n7. Any empty values should be indicated by null and not an empty string.\n8. Double check your logic and see if the data you have collected is actually reflected in the text. If not, make revisions.\n9. Assemble all sets and produce 1 final JSON output in a single line without any whitespaces.\n***\nTASK"}
