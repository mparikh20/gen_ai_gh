Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) is a marker of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), and its enzymatic activity regulates tumor stemness. Identifying upstream targets to control ALDH+ cells may facilitate TNBC tumor suppression. Here, we show that KK-LC-1 determines the stemness of TNBC ALDH+ cells via binding with FAT1 and subsequently promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This compromises the Hippo pathway and leads to nuclear translocation of YAP1 and ALDH1A1 transcription. These findings identify the KK-LC-1-FAT1-Hippo-ALDH1A1 pathway in TNBC ALDH+ cells as a therapeutic target. To reverse the malignancy due to KK-LC-1 expression, we employ a computational approach and discover Z839878730 (Z8) as an small-molecule inhibitor which may disrupt KK-LC-1 and FAT1 binding. We demonstrate that Z8 suppresses TNBC tumor growth via a mechanism that reactivates the Hippo pathway and decreases TNBC ALDH+ cell stemness and viability."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37147285\": [{\"drug_name\": \"Z839878730 (Z8)\", \"direct_target\": \"KK-LC-1\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"Z839878730 (Z8)\", \"direct_target\": \"KK-LC-1/FAT1\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"binding disruptor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

There is increasing evidence to support that PELI1 functions as an oncoprotein in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the high expression and oncogenic roles of PELI1 in cancers remains limited. Herein, we revealed a novel regulation mechanism by which PELI1 and EGFR cooperate to promote breast cancer metastasis. EGFR is positively correlated with PELI1 expression in breast cancers, and its activation led to the phosphorylation of PELI1 at Tyr154 and Thr264, which subsequently activated its E3 ubiquitin ligase. Simultaneously, PELI1 physically interacted with and enhanced the stability of EGFR via the K63-linked polyubiquitination in reverse. The co-inhibition of the PELI1-EGFR showed synergetic effect to repress breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, we identified a compound S62 as a small molecule disruptor of PELI1/EGFR that effectively repressed breast cancer metastasis.

The mTOR kinase forms two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and understanding which is required for the survival of malignant cells has been limited by tools to selectively and completely impair either subcomplex. To address this, we used RMC-6272, a bi-steric molecule with a rapamycin-like moiety linked to an mTOR active-site inhibitor that displays >25-fold selectivity for mTORC1 over mTORC2 substrates. Complete suppression of mTORC1 by RMC-6272 causes apoptosis in ER+/HER2- breast cancer cell lines, particularly in those that harbor mutations in PIK3CA or PTEN, due to inhibition of the rapamycin resistant, mTORC1 substrate 4EBP1 and reduction of the pro-survival protein MCL1. RMC-6272 reduced translation of ribosomal mRNAs, MYC target genes, and components of the CDK4/6 pathway, suggesting enhanced impairment of oncogenic pathways compared to the partial mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus. RMC-6272 maintained efficacy in hormone therapy-resistant acquired cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), showed increased efficacy in CDK4/6 inhibitor treated acquired resistant cell lines versus their parental counterparts, and was efficacious in a PDX from a patient experiencing resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition.

Although many drivers of acquired drug resistance have been identified1-4, the underlying molecular mechanisms shaping tumour evolution during treatment are incompletely understood. Genomic profiling of patient tumours has implicated apolipoprotein\u2009B messenger RNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) cytidine deaminases in tumour evolution; however, their role during therapy and the development of acquired drug resistance is undefined. Here we report that lung cancer targeted therapies commonly used in the clinic can induce cytidine deaminase APOBEC3A (A3A), leading to sustained mutagenesis in drug-tolerant cancer cells persisting during therapy. Therapy-induced A3A promotes the formation of double-strand DNA breaks, increasing genomic instability in drug-tolerant persisters. Deletion of A3A reduces APOBEC mutations and structural variations in persister cells and delays the development of drug resistance. APOBEC mutational signatures are enriched in tumours from patients with lung cancer who progressed after extended responses to targeted therapies. This study shows that induction of A3A in response to targeted therapies drives evolution of drug-tolerant persister cells, suggesting that suppression of A3A expression or activity may represent a potential therapeutic strategy in the prevention or delay of acquired resistance to lung cancer targeted therapy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37407818\": [{\"drug_name\": null, \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

The substrates of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) show a promising anticancer effect in clinical trials. We previously identified a natural NQO1 substrate 2-methoxy-6-acetyl-7-methyljuglone (MAM) with a potent anticancer effect. The present study was designed to explore the efficacy of MAM in fighting against drug-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The anticancer effect of MAM was evaluated in cisplatin-resistant A549 and AZD9291-resistant H1975 cells. The interaction of MAM with NQO1 was measured by cellular thermal shift assay and drug affinity responsive target stability assay. The NQO1 activity and expression were measured using NQO1 recombinant protein, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining assay. The roles of NQO1 were examined by NQO1 inhibitor, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA). The roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS), labile iron pool (LIP), and lipid peroxidation were determined. MAM induced significant cell death in drug-resistant cells with similar potency to that of parental cells, which were completely abolished by NQO1 inhibitor, NQO1 siRNA, and iron chelators. MAM activates and binds to NQO1, which triggers ROS generation, LIP increase, and lipid peroxidation. MAM significantly suppressed tumor growth in the tumor xenograft zebrafish model. These results showed that MAM induced ferroptosis by targeting NQO1 in drug-resistant NSCLC cells.

PF-07284892 (ARRY-558) is an allosteric SHP2 inhibitor designed to overcome bypass-signaling-mediated resistance when combined with inhibitors of various oncogenic drivers. Activity in this setting was confirmed in diverse tumor models. Patients with ALK fusion-positive lung cancer, BRAFV600E-mutant colorectal cancer, KRASG12D-mutant ovarian cancer, and ROS1 fusion-positive pancreatic cancer who previously developed targeted therapy resistance were treated with PF-07284892 on the first dose level of a first-in-human clinical trial. After progression on PF-07284892 monotherapy, a novel study design allowed the addition of oncogene-directed targeted therapy that had previously failed. Combination therapy led to rapid tumor and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) responses and extended the duration of overall clinical benefit.[SIGNIFICANCE]PF-07284892-targeted therapy combinations overcame bypass-signaling-mediated resistance in a clinical setting in which neither component was active on its own. This provides proof of concept of the utility of SHP2 inhibitors in overcoming resistance to diverse targeted therapies and provides a paradigm for accelerated testing of novel drug combinations early in clinical development.

About 93% of PDACs have KRAS mutations, with G12D (\u223c42% of cases) and G12V (\u223c32% of cases) being the most common. The recent approval of sotorasib (AMG510), a small-molecule, covalent, and selective KRASG12C inhibitor, for treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer represents a breakthrough in KRAS targeted therapy. However, there is a need to develop other much-needed KRAS-mutant inhibitors for PDAC therapy. Notably, Mirati Therapeutics recently developed MRTX1133, a small-molecule, noncovalent, and selective KRASG12D inhibitor through extensive structure-based drug design. MRTX1133 has demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy against KRASG12D-mutant cancer cells, especially in PDAC, leading to its recent initiation of a phase I/II clinical trial. Here, we provide a summary of the recent advancements related to the use of MRTX1133 for treating KRASG12D-mutant PDAC, focusing on its efficacy and underlying mechanistic actions. In addition, we discuss potential challenges and future directions for MRTX1133 therapy for PDAC, including overcoming intrinsic and acquired drug resistance, developing effective combination therapies, and improving MRTX1133's oral bioavailability and target spectrum.

Despite this, treatment with this class of drugs induces unwanted side effects (including cardiovascular morbidity and secondary malignancies). Additionally, the emergence of drug resistance also greatly compromises the clinical use of these drugs. To enhance therapeutic efficiency while lowering unwanted side effects, new insights into effective combination therapy are required. In this study we found that KU60019, a novel, and highly specific ATM kinase inhibitor interferes with the association of ATM with TOP2\u03b2 and stabilizes TOP2\u03b2-DNA cleavage complex, thereby impairing the repair of TOP2 poison-induced DSBs and contributes to genome stability, leading to accelerated cell death. In H1299 as well as in A549 lung cancer cell lines, biologically, KU60019 combined with VP-16 (one of the TOP2 poisons) synergistically suppressed the growth of cells and survival and triggered a much higher apoptosis rate. In summary, we provide a proof-of-concept strategy that ATM inhibitors combined with TOP2 poison would synergistically suppresses lung cancer cell survival as well as reduce DNA damage responses, thus may lowering the possibility of cardiotoxicity and secondary malignancy linked to therapy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36650267\": [{\"drug_name\": \"KU60019\", \"direct_target\": \"ATM\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"KU60019\", \"direct_target\": \"ATM/TOP2\\u03b2\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"disruptor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"VP-16\", \"direct_target\": \"TOP2\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"poison\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"KU60019\", \"direct_target\": \"TOP2\\u03b2-DNA\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"stabilizer\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Drug repurposing and nano-drug delivery systems are attracting considerable attention for improving anti-cancer therapy. Sertaconazole (STZ), an antifungal agent, has been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against both normal and tumor cells, and its medical use is limited by its poor solubility. In order to overcome such shortcomings, we prepared a drug-repurposed nanoplatform to enhance the anti-tumor efficiency.[METHODS]Nanoplatform was prepared by thin film dispersion. Drug release studies and uptake studies were measured in vitro. Subsequently, we verified the tumor inhibition mechanisms of HTS NPs through apoptosis assay, immunoblotting and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection analyses. Antitumor activity was evaluated on an established xenograft lung cancer model in vivo.[RESULTS]Our nanoplatform improved the solubility of sertaconazole and increased its accumulation in tumor cells. Mechanistically, HTS NPs was dependent on ROS-mediated apoptosis and pro-apoptotic autophagy to achieve their excellent anti-tumor effects.

Afatinib, gefitinib, osimertinib, and carboplatin plus pemetrexed chemotherapy were the treatments he received. At the 15th month of osimertinib therapy, the patient developed QTc prolongation. Two weeks after the first incidence of QTc prolongation, electrocardiography showed rate-controlled atrial fibrillation. In addition to his atrial fibrillation, echocardiography revealed severely impaired left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction: 30%).[MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES]Baseline to osimertinib, an electrocardiography investigation was carried out as per the protocol. Baseline drug history was reviewed and rosuvastatin was discontinued before initiating osimertinib as both drugs contribute to QTc prolongation. Dabigatran, bisoprolol, and digoxin were started for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Ramipril and spironolactone were prescribed for the treatment of heart failure but osimertinib continued uneventfully. The patient died of non-small cell lung cancer.[DISCUSSION]Recommendations for practical and clinically relevant baseline and on-treatment assessments are considered which may reduce the risk of cardiac toxicity during osimertinib therapy.

The implementation of combinatorial approaches involving MEK1/2 or KRASG12C inhibitors in the context of KRAS-mutated lung cancers focuses fundamentally on targeting KRAS proximal activators or effectors. However, the antitumor effect is highly determined by compensatory mechanisms arising in defined cell types or tumor subgroups. A potential strategy to find drug combinations targeting a larger fraction of KRAS-mutated lung cancers may capitalize on the common, distal gene expression output elicited by oncogenic KRAS. By integrating a signature-driven drug repurposing approach with a pairwise pharmacological screen, here we show synergistic drug combinations consisting of multi-tyrosine kinase PKC inhibitors together with MEK1/2 or KRASG12C inhibitors. Such combinations elicit a cytotoxic response in both in vitro and in vivo models, which in part involves inhibition of the PKC inhibitor target AURKB. Proteome profiling links dysregulation of MYC expression to the effect of both PKC inhibitor-based drug combinations. Furthermore, MYC overexpression appears as a resistance mechanism to MEK1/2 and KRASG12C inhibitors.

Metabolic flux analysis demonstrated that pyruvate metabolism and fatty acid oxidation were markedly enhanced and coordinately powered the OXPHOS system in resistant cells after trametinib treatment, satisfying their energy demand and protecting them from apoptosis. As molecular events in this process, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase IA (CPTIA), two rate-limiting enzymes that control the metabolic flux of pyruvate and palmitic acid to mitochondrial respiration were activated through phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation.

O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is primarily responsible for the TMZ resistance in Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. In addition, active DNA damage repair pathways can also lead to TMZ resistance. Here, we reported a novel small-molecule inhibitor EPIC-0412 that improved the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ by \u2028inhibiting the DNA damage repair pathway and MGMT in GBM via epigenetic pathways.[METHODS]The small-molecule compound EPIC-0412 was obtained through high-throughput screening. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to verify the effect of EPIC-0412. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was used to elucidate the interactions of transcription factors at the MGMT promoter region. Animal experiments using a mouse model were performed to verify the efficacy of EPIC-0412 in sensitizing GBM cells to TMZ.[RESULTS]EPIC-0412 physically interrupts the binding of HOTAIR and EZH2, leading to the upregulation of CDKN1A and BBC3, causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in GBM cells. EPIC-0412 inhibits DNA damage response in GBM cells through the p21-E2F1 DNA damage repair axis. EPIC-0412 epigenetically silences MGMT through its interaction with the ATF3-p-p65-HADC1 axis at the MGMT promoter region. The application of EPIC-0412 restored the TMZ sensitivity in GBM in vivo experiments.[CONCLUSION]This study discovered a small-molecule inhibitor EPIC-0412, which enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect of TMZ by acting on the p21-E2F1 DNA damage repair axis and ATF3-p-p65-MGMT axis, providing \u2028evidence for combining epigenetic drugs to increase the sensitization toward TMZ in GBM patients."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36272139\": [{\"drug_name\": \"EPIC-0412\", \"direct_target\": \"HOTAIR/EZH2\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"binding disruptor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"EPIC-0412\", \"direct_target\": \"MGMT\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"epigenetic silencer\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"EPIC-0412\", \"direct_target\": \"ATF3-p-p65-HADC1 axis\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"interactor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"temozolomide (TMZ)\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Among chemotherapeutics, temozolomide is considered as the first-line drug for GBM therapy, but the treatment outcome is not satisfactory. Notably, regorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, has been reported to exert a markedly superior effect on GBM suppression compared with temozolomide. However, poor site-specific delivery and bioavailability significantly restrict the efficient permeability of regorafenib to brain lesions and compromise its treatment efficacy. Therefore, human H-ferritin (HFn), regorafenib, and Cu2+ are rationally designed as a brain-targeted nanoplatform (HFn-Cu-REGO NPs), fulfilling the task of site-specific delivery and manipulating autophagy and cuproptosis against GBM. Herein, HFn affords a preferential accumulation capacity to GBM due to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)-mediated active targeting and pH-responsive delivery behavior. Moreover, regorafenib can inhibit autophagosome-lysosome fusion, resulting in lethal autophagy arrest in GBM cells. Furthermore, Cu2+ not only facilitates the encapsulation of regorafenib to HFn through coordination interaction but also disturbs copper homeostasis for triggering cuproptosis, resulting in a synergistical effect with regorafenib-mediated lethal autophagy arrest against GBM.

Preclinical and early-phase clinical data suggested efficacy of depatuxizumab mafodotin (depatux-m), an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a monoclonal antibody that binds activated EGFR (overexpressed wild-type and EGFRvIII-mutant) linked to a microtubule-inhibitor toxin in EGFR-amp GBMs.[METHODS]In this phase III trial, adults with centrally confirmed, EGFR-amp newly diagnosed GBM were randomized 1:1 to radiotherapy, temozolomide, and depatux-m/placebo. Corneal epitheliopathy was treated with a combination of protocol-specified prophylactic and supportive measures. There was 85% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) \u22640.75 for overall survival (OS) at a 2.5% 1-sided significance level (ie traditional two-sided p \u2264 0.05) by log-rank testing.[RESULTS]There were 639 randomized patients (median age 60, range 22-84; 62% men). Prespecified interim analysis found no improvement in OS for depatux-m over placebo (median 18.9 vs. 18.7 months, HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82-1.26, 1-sided p = 0.63). Progression-free survival was longer for depatux-m than placebo (median 8.0 vs. 6.3 months; HR 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.01, p = 0.029), particularly among those with EGFRvIII-mutant (median 8.3 vs. 5.9 months, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.93, 1-sided p = 0.002) or MGMT unmethylated (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.97; 1-sided p = 0.012) tumors but without an OS improvement. Corneal epitheliopathy occurred in 94% of depatux-m-treated patients (61% grade 3-4), causing 12% to discontinue.[CONCLUSIONS]Interim analysis demonstrated no OS benefit for depatux-m in treating EGFR-amp newly diagnosed GBM.

SurVaxM is a peptide vaccine conjugate that has been shown to activate the immune system against its target molecule survivin, which is highly expressed by glioblastoma cells. We conducted a phase IIa, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating the safety, immunologic effects, and survival of patients with nGBM receiving SurVaxM plus adjuvant TMZ following surgery and chemoradiation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02455557).[METHODS]Sixty-four patients with resected nGBM were enrolled including 38 men and 26 women, in the age range of 20-82 years. Following craniotomy and fractionated radiation therapy with concurrent TMZ, patients received four doses of SurVaxM (500 \u03bcg once every 2 weeks) in Montanide ISA-51 plus sargramostim (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) subcutaneously. Patients subsequently received adjuvant TMZ and maintenance SurVaxM concurrently until progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were reported. Immunologic responses to SurVaxM were assessed.[RESULTS]SurVaxM plus TMZ was well tolerated with no serious adverse events attributable to SurVaxM. Of the 63 patients who were evaluable for outcome, 60 (95.2%) remained progression-free 6 months after diagnosis (prespecified primary end point). Median PFS was 11.4 months and median OS was 25.9 months measured from first dose of SurVaxM. SurVaxM produced survivin-specific CD8+ T cells and antibody/immunoglobulin G titers. Apparent clinical benefit of SurVaxM was observed in both methylated and unmethylated patients.[CONCLUSION]SurVaxM appeared to be safe and well tolerated. The combination represents a promising therapy for nGBM. For patients with nGBM treated in this manner, PFS may be an acceptable surrogate for OS.

Autophagy also plays a key role in tumor resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy or targeted therapy. Inhibition of autophagy is therefore a promising tumor treatment strategy. However, there is still a lack of effective autophagy inhibitors suitable for clinical use.

Pyroptosis has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer, but there is still a need for new pyroptosis boosters to target cancer cells. In this study, it is reported that Aloe-emodin (AE), a natural compound derived from plants, can inhibit GBM cells by inducing pyroptosis, making it a potential booster for pyroptosis-mediated GBM therapy. However, administering AE is challenging due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its non-selectivity. To overcome this obstacle, AE@ZIF-8 NPs are developed, a biomineralized nanocarrier that releases AE in response to the tumor's acidic microenvironment (TAM). Further modification of the nanocarrier with transferrin (Tf) and polyethylene glycol-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-PLGA) improves its penetration through the BBB and tumor targeting, respectively. The results show that AE-NPs (Tf-PEG-PLGA modified AE@ZIF-8 NPs) significantly increase the intracranial distribution and tumor tissue accumulation, enhancing GBM pyroptosis. Additionally, AE-NPs activate antitumor immunity and reduce AE-related toxicity.

Whether TGF-\u03b2 in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) induces senescence in cancer and how the ensuing senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) remodels the cellular TME to influence immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) responses are unknown. We show that TGF-\u03b2 induces a deeper senescent state under hypoxia than under normoxia; deep senescence correlates with the degree of E2F suppression and is marked by multinucleation, reduced reentry into proliferation, and a distinct 14-gene SASP. Suppressing TGF-\u03b2 signaling in tumors in an immunocompetent mouse lung cancer model abrogates endogenous senescent cells and suppresses the 14-gene SASP and immune infiltration. Untreated human lung cancers with a high 14-gene SASP display immunosuppressive immune infiltration. In a lung cancer clinical trial of ICIs, elevated 14-gene SASP is associated with increased senescence, TGF-\u03b2 and hypoxia signaling, and poor progression-free survival.

With omics and functional assays deploying patient-derived in vitro and in vivo models, we show that macroH2A2 shapes chromatin accessibility at enhancer elements to antagonize transcriptional programs of self-renewal. macroH2A2 also sensitizes cells to small molecule-mediated cell death via activation of a viral mimicry response. Consistent with these results, our analyses of clinical cohorts indicate that high transcriptional levels of this histone variant are associated with better prognosis of high-grade glioma patients. Our results reveal a targetable epigenetic mechanism of self-renewal controlled by macroH2A2 and suggest additional treatment approaches for glioblastoma patients."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37244935\": [{\"drug_name\": null, \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}
