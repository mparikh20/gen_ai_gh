Data on the efficacy and safety of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib, as an addition to fulvestrant therapy, in patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer are limited.[METHODS]In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial, we enrolled eligible pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women and men with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer who had had a relapse or disease progression during or after treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with or without previous cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor therapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive capivasertib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. The dual primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival assessed both in the overall population and among patients with AKT pathway-altered ([RESULTS]Overall, 708 patients underwent randomization; 289 patients (40.8%) had AKT pathway alterations, and 489 (69.1%) had received a CDK4/6 inhibitor previously for advanced breast cancer. In the overall population, the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 3.6 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.71; P<0.001). In the AKT pathway-altered population, the median progression-free survival was 7.3 months in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 3.1 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.65; P<0.001). The most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or higher in patients receiving capivasertib-fulvestrant were rash (in 12.1% of patients, vs. in 0.3% of those receiving placebo-fulvestrant) and diarrhea (in 9.3% vs. 0.3%). Adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 13.0% of the patients receiving capivasertib and in 2.3% of those receiving placebo.[CONCLUSIONS]Capivasertib-fulvestrant therapy resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than treatment with fulvestrant alone among patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer whose disease had progressed during or after previous aromatase inhibitor therapy with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

Camizestrant is a next-generation oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that in a phase II study significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) over fulvestrant (also a SERD) in ER+/HER2- ABC. SERENA-6 (NCT04964934) is a randomized, double-blind, phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of switching from an AI to camizestrant, while maintaining the same CDK4/6i, upon detection of ESR1m in circulating tumor DNA before clinical disease progression on first-line therapy for HR+/HER2- ABC. The aim is to treat ESR1m clones and extend the duration of control of ER-driven tumor growth, delaying the need for chemotherapy. The primary end point is PFS; secondary end points include chemotherapy-free survival, time to second progression event (PFS2), overall survival, patient-reported outcomes and safety.Why will we perform this study? Patients with advanced breast cancer in which the cancer cells have the receptor for the hormone estrogen and/or progesterone are typically treated with an aromatase inhibitor, a hormone therapy that decreases estrogen being made in the body, together with an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), a drug that blocks the growth of cancer cells. Although cancers usually respond to treatment initially, the cancer cells eventually change, so the drug combination no longer works. For example, mutation of the estrogen receptor (referred to as ESR1m) can stop aromatase inhibitors from working. Camizestrant is an investigational drug that blocks estrogen receptors, including mutated receptors, reducing the growth and spread of cancer. Here we describe the SERENA-6 clinical trial, which is testing camizestrant as a treatment for patients with breast cancer with ESR1m. How will we perform this research? The phase III SERENA-6 trial will use blood tests to monitor if patients with breast cancer develop ESR1m while being treated with an aromatase inhibitor and a CDK4/6 inhibitor. If ESR1m is detected, yet the disease is stable, participants will be randomly assigned to either continue with the same aromatase inhibitor or switch to camizestrant while continuing with the same CDK4/6 inhibitor. The study will assess whether switching to camizestrant prolongs the time before the cancer grows, spreads or worsens. It will also assess the length of time that participants live for versus those who continue with an aromatase inhibitor.

While the metabolic role of ACSS2 in cancer is well described, the consequences of blocking tumor acetate metabolism on the tumor microenvironment and antitumor immunity are unknown. We demonstrate that blocking ACSS2, switches cancer cells from acetate consumers to producers of acetate thereby freeing acetate for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to use as a fuel source. We show that acetate supplementation metabolically bolsters T-cell effector functions and proliferation. Targeting ACSS2 with CRISPR-Cas9 guides or a small-molecule inhibitor promotes an antitumor immune response and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in preclinical breast cancer models. We propose a paradigm for targeting acetate metabolism in cancer in which inhibition of ACSS2 dually acts to impair tumor cell metabolism and potentiate antitumor immunity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37723305\": [{\"drug_name\": null, \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Analysis of ~3,000 human breast cancers (BCs) showed that ~30% of them could benefice from HDAC6i therapy.

Fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader, is commonly used for treating patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, but its broad and continual application is limited by poor solubility, invasive muscle administration, and drug resistance. Here, we developed an active targeting motif-modified, intravenously injectable, hydrophilic NP that encapsulates fulvestrant to facilitate its delivery via the bloodstream to tumors, improving bioavailability and systemic tolerability. In addition, the NP was coloaded with abemaciclib, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), to prevent the development of drug resistance associated with long-term fulvestrant treatment. Targeting peptide modifications on the NP surface assisted in the site-specific release of the drugs to ensure specific toxicity in the tumor tissues and to spare normal tissue. The NP formulation (PPFA-cRGD) exhibited efficient tumor cell killing in both in vitro organoid models and in vivo orthotopic ER-positive breast cancer models without apparent adverse effects, as verified in mouse and Bama miniature pig models. This NP-based therapeutic provides an opportunity for continual and extensive clinical application of fulvestrant, thus indicating its promise as a treatment option for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.[SIGNIFICANCE]A smart nanomedicine encapsulating fulvestrant to improve its half-life, bioavailability, and tumor-targeting and coloaded with CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib to block resistance is a safe and effective therapy for ER-positive breast cancer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37326467\": [{\"drug_name\": \"fulvestrant\", \"direct_target\": \"ER\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"selective estrogen receptor degrader\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"abemaciclib\", \"direct_target\": \"CDK4\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"abemaciclib\", \"direct_target\": \"CDK6\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"nanoparticle (NP) formulation (PPFA-cRGD) coloaded with fulvestrant and abemaciclib\", \"direct_target\": \"ER\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"selective estrogen receptor degrader\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"nanoparticle (NP) formulation (PPFA-cRGD) coloaded with fulvestrant and abemaciclib\", \"direct_target\": \"CDK4\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"nanoparticle (NP) formulation (PPFA-cRGD) coloaded with fulvestrant and abemaciclib\", \"direct_target\": \"CDK6\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

The vast majority of these differences are L858R point mutations in Exon 21. Currently, monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of EGFR or small molecule/tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are the stalwarts of NSCLC therapy. Resistance, however, gradually develops because of the T790 mutation towards first and second generation TKIs. The third generation TKI AZD9291 (Osimertinib) has a high affinity for both activating and the acquired resistant mutation (T790\u00a0M) in EGFR, with a low affinity towards wild-type EGFR. Recent research, however, suggests that the EGFR (C797S) mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain is a likely cause of resistance to AZD9291. Another significant transformation mechanism associated with this resistance is erbB2 amplification.

Therefore, identification of novel molecular mediators that can potentially be exploited as therapeutic targets for treating osteolytic bone metastases is needed. A murine model of breast cancer bone metastasis was developed by injection of 4\u00a0T1.2 cells into the left ventricle and hence directly into the arterial system leading to bone. AEP (Asparagine endopeptidase) inhibitor combined with epirubicin or epirubicin alone was administered by intraperitoneal injection into animal model. The presence of bone metastatic and osteolytic lesions in bone were assessed by bioluminescent imaging and X-rays analysis. The expression of EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) relevant genes were examined by Western blotting. Cell migration and invasion were investigated with a transwell assay. Compound BIC-113, small molecule inhibitors of AEP, inhibited AEP enzymatic activity in breast cancer cell lines, and affected invasion and migration of cancer cells, but had no effect on cell growth. In animal model of breast cancer bone metastasis, compound BIC-113 combined with epirubicin inhibited breast cancer bone metastasis and attenuated breast cancer osteolytic lesions in bone by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and EMT. These results indicate that compound BIC-113 combined with epirubicin has the potential to be used in breast cancer therapy by preventing bone metastasis via improving E-cadherin expression and inhibition of osteoclast formation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36702335\": [{\"drug_name\": \"BIC-113\", \"direct_target\": \"AEP\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"epirubicin\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

We demonstrated that TNF\u03b1 induces mucin 4 (MUC4) expression, which shields the trastuzumab epitope on the HER2 molecule decreasing its therapeutic effect. Here, we used mouse models and samples from HER2+ breast cancer patients to unravel MUC4 participation in hindering trastuzumab effect by fostering immune evasion.[METHODS]We used a dominant negative TNF\u03b1 inhibitor (DN) selective for soluble TNF\u03b1 (sTNF\u03b1) together with trastuzumab. Preclinical experiments were performed using two models of conditionally MUC4-silenced tumors to characterize the immune cell infiltration. A cohort of 91 patients treated with trastuzumab was used to correlate tumor MUC4 with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.[RESULTS]In mice bearing de novo trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ breast tumors, neutralizing sTNF\u03b1 with DN induced MUC4 downregulation. Using the conditionally MUC4-silenced tumor models, the antitumor effect of trastuzumab was reinstated and the addition of TNF\u03b1-blocking agents did not further decrease tumor burden. DN administration with trastuzumab modifies the immunosuppressive tumor milieu through M1-like phenotype macrophage polarization and NK cells degranulation. Depletion experiments revealed a cross-talk between macrophages and NK cells necessary for trastuzumab antitumor effect. In addition, tumor cells treated with DN are more susceptible to trastuzumab-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Finally, MUC4 expression in HER2+ breast cancer is associated with immune desert tumors.[CONCLUSIONS]These findings provide rationale to pursue sTNF\u03b1 blockade combined with trastuzumab or trastuzumab drug conjugates for MUC4+ and HER2+ breast cancer patients to overcome trastuzumab resistance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36889811\": [{\"drug_name\": \"trastuzumab\", \"direct_target\": \"HER2\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"antibody\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Recent studies have explored several signaling pathways that govern stem cell activation: We and others established that the Notch1 signaling plays a significant role in the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of BCSCs. Earlier, we reported that a newly developed small molecule, ASR490, binds to the negative regulatory region (NRR: The activation switch of the Notch receptor) of Notch1. In vitro results demonstrated that ASR490 significantly inhibited BCSCs (ALDH+ and CD44+/CD24-) and breast cancer (BC) growth at nM concentrations, and subsequently inhibited the colony- and mammosphere-forming abilities of BCSCs and BCs. ASR490 downregulated the expressions of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD: The active form of Notch1) and its downstream effectors Hey1 and HES1. Inhibition of Notch1-NICD facilitated autophagy-mediated growth inhibition by triggering the fusion of autophagosome and autolysosome in BCSCs. ASR490 was found to be non-toxic to healthy cells as compared to existing Notch1 inhibitors. Moreover, oral administration of ASR490 abrogated BCSC and BC tumor growth in the in vivo xenograft models. Together our results indicate that ASR490 is a potential therapeutic agent that inhibits BC tumor growth by targeting and abolishing Notch1 signaling in BCSCs and BC cells."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36909163\": [{\"drug_name\": \"ASR490\", \"direct_target\": \"Notch1\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

It is a diverse illness with substantial intersubject heterogeneity, even among individuals with the same type of tumor, and customized therapy has become increasingly important in this sector. Because of the clinical and physical variability of different kinds of breast cancers, multiple staging and classification systems have been developed. As a result, these tumors exhibit a wide range of gene expression and prognostic indicators. To date, no comprehensive investigation of model training procedures on information from numerous cell line screenings has been conducted together with radiation data. We used human breast cancer cell lines and drug sensitivity information from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) databases to scan for potential drugs using cell line data. The results are further validated through three machine learning approaches: Elastic Net, LASSO, and Ridge. Next, we selected top-ranked biomarkers based on their role in breast cancer and tested them further for their resistance to radiation using the data from the Cleveland database. We have identified six drugs named Palbociclib, Panobinostat, PD-0325901, PLX4720, Selumetinib, and Tanespimycin that significantly perform on breast cancer cell lines. Also, five biomarkers named TNFSF15, DCAF6, KDM6A, PHETA2, and IFNGR1 are sensitive to all six shortlisted drugs and show sensitivity to the radiations.

This is largely driven by the inability of current therapeutics to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the lack of preclinical models for testing new therapies. Here we study the efficacy of AZD1390, a BBB penetrating ataxia-telangiectasia mutated inhibitor, as a radiosensitizer for breast cancer CM treatment.[EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN]Three patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors including 2 HER2+ and 1 triple-negative breast cancer harboring DNA damage response (DDR) gene mutations, were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of mice to assess tumor growth inhibition by AZD1390 combined with radiation. Animal survival was further assessed by implanting the best responding PDX model orthotopically in the brain.[RESULTS]Pretreatment with AZD1390 followed by radiation therapy inhibited growth of PDX tumors implanted in the flank, and improved survival in orthotopic models with average survival of 222 days compared with 123 days in controls. Administration of AZD1390 posttreatment for 21 days had no further benefits. While the combination therapy resulted in sustained tumor inhibition, sporadic regrowth was observed in some mice 50 to 100 days posttreatment in all models. Gene expression comparing these tumors with complete responders demonstrated changes in upregulation of oncogenic proteins, which are potential drivers of tumor growth after treatment.[CONCLUSIONS]Our results demonstrate that AZD1390 effectively sensitizes breast cancer CM to radiation therapy in DDR mutant tumors.

No comparative data exists between agents regarding toxicity or efficacy.[METHODS]A retrospective study was performed at our tertiary referral centre evaluating patients on a CDK4/6 inhibitor for MBC between July 2017 and December 2021. Toxicity was evaluated along with variability in full blood counts and liver function over the first 12 weeks of therapy.[RESULTS]Two hundred and seventeen patients were treated (palbociclib 59%, abemaciclib 25% and ribociclib 16%). 86% received the agent as 1st line therapy. Most patients were white women with a median age of 61 years (32-95) and ECOG 0/1. Twelve patients were switched to an alternative CDK4/6 inhibitor due to toxicity and two did not tolerate this. Toxicity profiles of agents were consistent with published trials. However, there was greater overlap in hepatitis, diarrhoea and bone marrow suppression. Blood results indicated a minimum of four weeks treatment before development of neutropenia. Forty percent of patients went onto have subsequent lines of therapy. The progression-free survival per agent was palbociclib 27.9 months (95% CI 23-32.5), ribociclib 29 months (95% CI 21.5-37.0) and abemaciclib 20.6 months (95% CI 15.0-26.0). The overall survival was palbociclib 38.0 months (95% CI 33.5-42.5), ribociclib 33.9 months (95% CI 26.7-41.1) and abemaciclib 27.3 months (95% CI 22.5-32.1).[CONCLUSIONS]Toxicity across CDK4/6 inhibitors overlaps.

Depletion of NF1 in PIK3CAH1047R breast cancer cell lines and a patient-derived organoid model shows that NF1 loss reduces sensitivity to PI3K\u03b1 inhibition and correlates with enhanced glycolysis and lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

ESR1-TAFs are not directly druggable because the C-terminal estrogen/anti-estrogen-binding domain is replaced with translocated in-frame partner gene sequences that confer constitutive transactivation. To discover alternative treatments, a mass spectrometry (MS)-based kinase inhibitor pulldown assay (KIPA) was deployed to identify druggable kinases that are upregulated by diverse ESR1-TAFs. Subsequent explorations of drug sensitivity validated RET kinase as a common therapeutic vulnerability despite remarkable ESR1-TAF C-terminal sequence and structural diversity. Organoids and xenografts from a pan-ET-resistant patient-derived xenograft model that harbors the ESR1-e6>YAP1 TAF were concordantly inhibited by the selective RET inhibitor pralsetinib to a similar extent as the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib.

Due to the time-consuming and expensive biological experiments required to validate SM-miRNA associations, there is an urgent need to develop new computational models to predict novel SM-miRNA associations. The rapid development of end-to-end deep learning models and the introduction of ensemble learning ideas provide us with new solutions. Based on the idea of ensemble learning, we integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to propose a miRNA and small molecule association prediction model (GCNNMMA). Firstly, we use GNNs to effectively learn the molecular structure graph data of small molecule drugs, while using CNNs to learn the sequence data of miRNAs. Secondly, since the black-box effect of deep learning models makes them difficult to analyze and interpret, we introduce attention mechanisms to address this issue. Finally, the neural attention mechanism allows the CNNs model to learn the sequence data of miRNAs to determine the weight of sub-sequences in miRNAs, and then predict the association between miRNAs and small molecule drugs. To evaluate the effectiveness of GCNNMMA, we implement two different cross-validation (CV) methods based on two different datasets. Experimental results show that the cross-validation results of GCNNMMA on both datasets are better than those of other comparison models. In a case study, Fluorouracil was found to be associated with five different miRNAs in the top 10 predicted associations, and published experimental literature confirmed that Fluorouracil is a metabolic inhibitor used to treat liver cancer, breast cancer, and other tumors. Therefore, GCNNMMA is an effective tool for mining the relationship between small molecule drugs and miRNAs relevant to diseases."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37323664\": [{\"drug_name\": \"fluorouracil\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

The incidence rate of women's breast cancer in 2020 was 2,261,419 and 2022 estimates diagnosing 1,918,030 cases. The disease is heterogeneous and the pathogenesis of breast cancer still remains unclear. Much progress has been made in early detection and better treatment to improve survival. Unfortunately, the current treatment strategies destroy the patient's quality of life. The patients develop drug resistance, exhibit severe side effects, and not afford the cost creates anxiety among the patients, families, and friends. In addition, a considerable number of patients relapse as a result of organ metastasis, e.g., the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, ER-/PR-HER2-). The 5-year survival rate of patients who recurred with distant metastasis is less than 20%. More than half a million women worldwide still suffer from metastatic breast cancer annually, and 90% of their deaths could be attributed to metastasis. One of the reasons for the failure of cancer therapeutics is the approaches did not consider the cancer holistically. All breast cancer cells and their micro environmental capillary endothelial cells express asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycoproteins. We have tested a biologic and a small molecule, Tunicamycin-P (P = pure N-glycosylation inhibitor) to interfere with the protein N-glycosylation pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by specifically blocking the catalytic activity of N-acetylglusosaminyl 1-phosphate transferase (GPT) activity. The outcome has been quantitative inhibition of in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis and the breast tumor progression of multiple subtypes in pre-clinical mouse models with \"zero\" toxicity.

Herein, a combination therapy strategy based on an extracellular matrix (ECM) modulator and TME-responsive drug for the first attempt of mechanochemically synergistic treatment of breast cancer is developed.

It is demonstrated that NQO1 can trigger the degradation of NQO1-SN38 and release SN38, showing nearly twice tumor inhibition efficiency compared with SN38 treatment in vitro.

Although most patients are initially sensitive to first-line combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, chemotherapy drug resistance easily develops and quickly leads to tumour progression. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of chemotherapy drug resistance and how to reverse it is key to improving the prognosis of patients with SCLC. Moreover, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification and is catalysed by the methyltransferase complex, in which methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) is the sole catalytic subunit.[METHODS]The effects of METTL3 on chemoresistance in SCLC cells were determined using qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, cell counting kit (CCK-8) assays, flow cytometry, and tumorigenicity experiments. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq), MeRIP qPCR, immunofluorescence, and drug inhibitor experiments were performed to confirm the molecular mechanism of Decapping Protein 2 (DCP2), which is involved in the chemoresistance of SCLC.[RESULTS]In the present study, we found that METTL3 is a marker for poor SCLC prognosis, and it is highly expressed in chemoresistant SCLC cells. METTL3 promotes SCLC chemoresistance by positively regulating mitophagy. METTL3 induces m6A methylation of DCP2 and causes the degradation of DCP2, which promotes mitochondrial autophagy through the Pink1-Parkin pathway, leading to chemotherapy resistance. We also found that STM2457, a novel METTL3 inhibitor, can reverse SCLC chemoresistance.[CONCLUSIONS]The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 regulates Pink1-Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy and mitochondrial damage in SCLC cells by targeting DCP2, thereby promoting chemotherapy resistance in patients with SCLC."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36932427\": [{\"drug_name\": \"STM2457\", \"direct_target\": \"METTL3\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Metabolic adaptation is a distinct hallmark of human lung cancer that might contribute to acquired resistance. In this study, we discovered a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) mediated by IGF2BP3-dependent cross-talk between epigenetic modifications and metabolic reprogramming through the IGF2BP3-COX6B2 axis. IGF2BP3 was upregulated in patients with TKI-resistant non-small cell lung cancer, and high IGF2BP3 expression correlated with reduced overall survival. Upregulated expression of the RNA binding protein IGF2BP3 in lung cancer cells reduced sensitivity to TKI treatment and exacerbated the development of drug resistance via promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). COX6B2 mRNA bound IGF2BP3, and COX6B2 was required for increased OXPHOS and acquired EGFR-TKI resistance mediated by IGF2BP3. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3 bound to the 3'-untranslated region of COX6B2 in an m6A-dependent manner to increase COX6B2 mRNA stability. Moreover, the IGF2BP3-COX6B2 axis regulated nicotinamide metabolism, which can alter OXPHOS and promote EGFR-TKI acquired resistance. Inhibition of OXPHOS with IACS-010759, a small-molecule inhibitor, resulted in strong growth suppression in vitro and in vivo in a gefitinib-resistant patient-derived xenograft model. Collectively, these findings suggest that metabolic reprogramming by the IGF2BP3-COX6B2 axis plays a critical role in TKI resistance and confers a targetable metabolic vulnerability to overcome acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer.[SIGNIFICANCE]IGF2BP3 stabilizes COX6B2 to increase oxidative phosphorylation and to drive resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer, which provides a therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired resistance by targeting metabolic transitions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37061993\": [{\"drug_name\": \"IACS-010759\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Our approach includes genome-wide CRISPR screens with or without drugs targeting the oncogenic driver (\"anchor therapy\"), and large-scale pairwise combination screens of anchor therapies with 351 other drugs. Interestingly, targeting of a small number of genes, including MCL1, BCL2L1, and YAP1, sensitizes multiple cell lines to the respective anchor therapy. Data from drug combination screens with EGF816 and ceritinib indicate that dasatinib and agents disrupting microtubules act synergistically across many cell lines. Finally, we show that a higher-order-combination screen with 26 selected drugs in two resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines identified active triplet combinations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36961816\": [{\"drug_name\": \"EGF816\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"ceritinib\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"dasatinib\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85\u00a0% of lung cancers. Mitochondrial methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) is a bifunctional enzyme and is the most differentially expressed metabolic enzyme in various tumors including lung cancer. However, little is known about how MTHFD2 functions in NSCLC. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling plays key a role in tumor progression including metastasis, proliferation and migration. Here, we show that MTHFD2 inhibition results in suppression of cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC. Microarray analysis suggests that MTHFD2 is positively associated with ILK signaling based on western blotting results. In addition, the phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1 plays an essential role in MTHFD2 regulation of ILK signaling. Further, the\u00a0small-molecule compound C18 inhibits MTHFD2 with great efficiency. C18 blocks MTHFD2/ILK signaling pathway and restrains cell growth, migration, invasion, and EMT of NSCLC and induces apoptosis. In brief, our study found that the positive impact of MTHFD2 is mediated via ILK signaling pathway in NSCLC.

Ferroptosis therapy has recently been raised as a promising strategy for lung cancer treatment by boosting the reactive species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation (LPO) accumulation intracellularly. However, the insufficient intracellular ROS level and the unsatisfactory drug accumulation in lung cancer lesions hamper the efficacy of ferroptosis therapy. Here, an inhalable biomineralized liposome LDM co-loaded with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and pH-responsive calcium phosphate (CaP) was constructed as a ferroptosis nanoinducer for achieving Ca2+-burst-centered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress enhanced lung cancer ferroptosis therapy. Equipped with excellent nebulization properties, about 6.80-fold higher lung lesions drug accumulation than intravenous injection made the proposed inhalable LDM an ideal nanoplatform for lung cancer treatment. The Fenton-like reaction mediated by DHA with peroxide bridge structure could contribute to intracellular ROS production and induce ferroptosis. Assisted by DHA-mediated sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition, the initial Ca2+ burst caused by CaP shell degradation triggered the Ca2+-mediated intense ER stress and subsequently induced mitochondria dysfunction to further boost ROS accumulation, which strengthens ferroptosis. The second Ca2+ burst occurred as a result of Ca2+ influx through ferroptotic pores on cell membranes, thus sequentially constructing the lethal \"Ca2+ burst-ER stress-ferroptosis\" cycle. Consequently, the Ca2+-burst-centered ER stress enhanced ferroptosis process was confirmed as a cell swelling and cell membrane disruption process driven by notable intracellular ROS and LPO accumulation. The proposed LDM showed an encouraging lung retention property and extraordinary antitumor ability in an orthotropic lung tumor murine model. In conclusion, the constructed ferroptosis nanoinducer could be a potential tailored nanoplatform for nebulization-based pulmonary delivery and underscore the application of Ca2+-burst-centered ER stress enhanced lung cancer ferroptosis therapy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36883602\": [{\"drug_name\": \"dihydroartemisinin (DHA)\", \"direct_target\": \"SERCA\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"inhalable biomineralized liposome LDM co-loaded with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and pH-responsive calcium phosphate (CaP)\", \"direct_target\": \"SERCA\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"calcium phosphate (CaP)\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Our functional screen of genetically probed macrophages with a chemical library identifies that TSN reverses macrophage-mediated tumor immunosuppression, leading to enhanced T cell infiltration, activation, and reduced exhaustion. Chemoproteomic and structural analyses revealed that TSN interacts with Hck and Lyn to abrogate suppressive macrophage immunity. In addition, a combination of immune checkpoint blockade and TSN therapy induced regression of syngeneic GBM tumors in mice. Furthermore, TSN treatment sensitized GBM to Egfrviii chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy.

Inhibition of autophagy is a promising strategy for tumor therapy. However, effective autophagy inhibitors suitable for clinical use are currently lacking.

The transcription factor EB (TFEB) is the central transcriptional regulator of autophagy, which promotes lysosomal biogenesis and functions and systematically up-regulates autophagy. Despite extensive evidence that TFEB is a promising target for autophagy inhibition, no small molecular TFEB inhibitors were reported.

The physical obstacle to drug delivery imposed by the blood\u2012brain barrier (BBB) and glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are widely recognized as crucial elements contributing to the unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. In this study, we found a small molecule, gambogic amide (GA-amide), exhibited the ability to effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and displayed a notable enrichment within the tumor region. Moreover, GA-amide exhibited significant efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth across various in vivo glioma models, encompassing transgenic and primary patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. We further performed a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) knockout screen to determine the druggable target of GA-amide. By the combination of the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) approach, molecular docking simulation and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, WD repeat domain 1 (WDR1) was identified as the direct binding target of GA-amide. Through direct interaction with WDR1, GA-amide promoted the formation of a complex involving WDR1, MYH9 and Cofilin, which accelerate the depolymerization of F-actin to inhibit the invasion of patient-derived glioma cells (PDCs) and induce PDC apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

Although exosomes have great potential for GBM treatment, these alone cannot fully meet the therapeutic requirements, owing to their limitations in targeting and delivery. Herein, engineered artificial vesicles (EAVs), ANG-TRP-PK1@EAVs, which are\u00a0constructed using a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG-TRP-PK1 peptides, is developed. ANG-TRP-PK1 is a fusion peptide of Angiopep-2 fused to the N-terminus of TRP-PK1, to present Angiopep-2 on the EAVs. ANG-TRP-PK1@EAVs have similar characteristics to the secreted exosomes, but a much higher yield. ANG-TRP-PK1@EAVs have efficient BBB-penetration and GBM-targeting abilities in a mock BBB model in in vitro and orthotopic GBM mouse models in vivo.

Its current first-line postsurgery regimens are radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, both of which are DNA damage-inducing therapies but show very limited efficacy and a high risk of resistance. There is an urgent need to develop novel agents to sensitize GBM to DNA-damaging treatments. Here it is found that the triterpene compound stellettin B (STELB) greatly enhances the sensitivity of GBM to ionizing radiation and TMZ in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, STELB inhibits the expression of homologous recombination repair (HR) factors BRCA1/2 and RAD51 by promoting the degradation of PI3K\u03b1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; and the induced HR deficiency then leads to augmented DNA damage and cell death. It is further demonstrated that STELB has the potential to rapidly penetrate the blood-brain barrier to exert anti-GBM effects in the brain, based on zebrafish and nude mouse orthotopic xenograft tumor models.

Yet the molecular mechanisms that determine susceptibility to DNLS-targeted therapies remain unknown, and the lack of brain-penetrant inhibitors of DNLS has prevented their clinical evaluation as GBM therapeutics. Here, we report that YTX-7739, a clinical-stage inhibitor of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD), triggers lipotoxicity in patient-derived GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) and inhibits fatty acid desaturation in GSCs orthotopically implanted in mice. When administered as a single agent, or in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), YTX-7739 showed therapeutic efficacy in orthotopic GSC mouse models owing to its lipotoxicity and ability to impair DNA damage repair. Leveraging genetic, pharmacological, and physiological manipulation of key signaling nodes in gliomagenesis complemented with shotgun lipidomics, we show that aberrant MEK/ERK signaling and its repression of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) primarily drive therapeutic vulnerability to SCD and other DNLS inhibitors. Conversely, AMPK activation mitigates lipotoxicity and renders GSCs resistant to the loss of DNLS, both in culture and in vivo, by decreasing the saturation state of phospholipids and diverting toxic lipids into lipid droplets. Together, our findings reveal mechanisms of metabolic plasticity in GSCs and provide a framework for the rational integration of DNLS-targeted GBM therapies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36652537\": [{\"drug_name\": \"YTX-7739\", \"direct_target\": \"SCD\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"temozolomide (TMZ)\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

To address this, we performed a correlative study in which we collected and analyzed peripheral blood of patients with glioblastoma (n\u00a0=\u00a020) receiving chemoradiotherapy using genomic and immune monitoring technologies. RNA sequencing analysis of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) showed an elevated concentration of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) regulatory genes in patients with lymphopenia when compared with patients without lymphopenia after chemoradiotherapy. Additional analysis including flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing further confirmed increased numbers of circulating MDSC in patients with lymphopenia when compared with patients without lymphopenia after chemoradiotherapy. Preclinical murine models were also established and demonstrated a causal relationship between radiation-induced MDSC and systemic lymphopenia using transfusion and depletion experiments. Pharmacological inhibition of MDSC using an arginase-1 inhibitor (CB1158) or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (tadalafil) during radiation therapy (RT) successfully abrogated radiation-induced lymphopenia and improved survival in the preclinical models.

However, few molecular mechanisms critical for CSC population maintenance have been exploited for therapeutic development. We developed a spatially resolved loss-of-function screen in GBM patient-derived organoids to identify essential epigenetic regulators in the SOX2-enriched, therapy-resistant niche and identified WDR5 as indispensable for this population. WDR5 is a component of the WRAD complex, which promotes SET1 family-mediated Lys4 methylation of histone H3 (H3K4me), associated with positive regulation of transcription. In GBM CSCs, WDR5 inhibitors blocked WRAD complex assembly and reduced H3K4 trimethylation and expression of genes involved in CSC-relevant oncogenic pathways. H3K4me3 peaks lost with WDR5 inhibitor treatment occurred disproportionally on POU transcription factor motifs, including the POU5F1(OCT4)::SOX2 motif. Use of a SOX2/OCT4 reporter demonstrated that WDR5 inhibitor treatment diminished cells with high reporter activity. Furthermore, WDR5 inhibitor treatment and WDR5 knockdown altered the stem cell state, disrupting CSC in vitro growth and self-renewal, as well as in vivo tumor growth. These findings highlight the role of WDR5 and the WRAD complex in maintaining the CSC state and provide a rationale for therapeutic development of WDR5 inhibitors for GBM and other advanced cancers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36732025\": [{\"drug_name\": null, \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Understanding the mechanisms of therapy resistance and identifying the drugs that enhance the therapeutic efficacy of standard therapies may extend the survival of GBM patients. In this study, we investigated the role of KDM1A/LSD1 in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and a combination of KDM1A inhibitor and temozolomide (TMZ) in vitro and in vivo using patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs).[METHODS]Brain bioavailability of the KDM1A inhibitor (NCD38) was established using LS-MS/MS. The effect of a combination of KDM1A knockdown or inhibition with TMZ was studied using cell viability and self-renewal assays. Mechanistic studies were conducted using CUT&Tag-seq, RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, western blot, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) reporter, immunofluorescence, and comet assays. Orthotopic murine models were used to study efficacy in vivo.[RESULTS]TCGA analysis showed KDM1A is highly expressed in TMZ-treated GBM patients. Knockdown or knockout or inhibition of KDM1A enhanced TMZ efficacy in reducing the viability and self-renewal of GSCs. Pharmacokinetic studies established that NCD38 readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. CUT&Tag-seq studies showed that KDM1A is enriched at the promoters of DNA repair genes and RNA-seq studies confirmed that KDM1A inhibition reduced their expression. Knockdown or inhibition of KDM1A attenuated HR and NHEJ-mediated DNA repair capacity and enhanced TMZ-mediated DNA damage. A\u00a0combination of KDM1A knockdown or inhibition and TMZ treatment significantly enhanced the survival of tumor-bearing mice.[CONCLUSIONS]Our results provide evidence that KDM1A inhibition sensitizes GBM to TMZ via attenuation of DNA DSB repair pathways."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36652263\": [{\"drug_name\": \"NCD38\", \"direct_target\": \"KDM1A\", \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": \"inhibitor\", \"clinical_trials_id\": null}, {\"drug_name\": \"temozolomide (TMZ)\", \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Examination of TAMC metabolic phenotypes in mouse models and patients with GBM identified the de novo creatine metabolic pathway as a hallmark of TAMCs. Multi-omics analyses revealed that TAMCs surround the hypoxic peri-necrotic regions of GBM and express the creatine metabolic enzyme glycine amidinotransferase (GATM). Conversely, GBM cells located within these same regions are uniquely specific in expressing the creatine transporter (SLC6A8). We hypothesized that TAMCs provide creatine to tumors, promoting GBM progression. Isotopic tracing demonstrated that TAMC-secreted creatine is taken up by tumor cells. Creatine supplementation protected tumors from hypoxia-induced stress, which was abrogated with genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of SLC6A8.

However, the role of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs in breast cancer remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and clinical applications of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs in breast cancer. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the GSE20685 dataset were used for screening cuproptosis-related lncRNAs. Colony formation and CCK-8 kit assays were performed for detecting the proliferative function of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs, whereas wound healing, migration, and invasion assays were performed for detecting the metastatic regulation of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs in breast cancer. Finally, a prognostic cuproptosis-related lncRNA model was constructed using LASSO Cox regression analysis for detecting survival and sensitivity to conventional treatment (endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) and novel therapy (PARP and CDK4/6 inhibitors). Results: In this study, we screened six cuproptosis-related lncRNAs associated with the survival of patients with breast cancer. Biofunctional experiments indicated that cuproptosis-related lncRNAs play essential roles in regulating the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Finally, we applied a model of six cuproptosis-related lncRNAs to classify the patients into high- and low-risk groups. High-risk group patients exhibited worse survival rates (p < 0.001) and lower sensitivity to chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and radiation therapy. Compared with high-risk patients, low-risk patients exhibited a lower expression of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant biomarkers (CCNE1, E2F1, and E2F2) and PARP inhibitor-resistant biomarkers (BRCA1/BRCA2), indicating that patients in the low-risk group were more suitable for PARP inhibitor and CDK4/6 inhibitor application. Conclusion: Cuproptosis-related lncRNAs are essential for regulating the biological functions of breast cancer, and they have the potential to predict prognosis and sensitivity of breast cancer to various therapies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37529698\": [{\"drug_name\": null, \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Despite their initial promise, current chemotherapeutic protocols are reaching their limits. This necessitates the prompt discovery of new molecular drivers and the development of novel regimens for advanced NSCLC. Herein, we pose that there is a need to systematically profile the human kinome activity of NSCLC. Using available state-of-the-art technologies, a wide gamut of kinase activities can be simultaneously mapped and quantified specifically in the primary or metastatic cancer states, with oncogenic kinase functions being likely linked to mutation signatures and malignant features of NSCLC. New chemical compound libraries can then be screened for kinase inhibitory properties in preclinical model systems, with presumptive induction of programmed cell-death subroutines and signaling-disintegration routes serving as major outputs of novel inhibitor tumor-suppressor potentials."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"37151885\": [{\"drug_name\": null, \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}

Among chemotherapy, the one that has developed rapidly is targeted therapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines have been updated recently for targeted therapy of multiple gene mutations, and targeted therapy is used not only for chemotherapy but also for adjuvant therapy. While previously targeted therapies have been developed for common genetic mutations, recently targeted therapies have been developed to overcome uncommon mutations or drug resistance that have occurred since previous targeted therapy.

Despite the availability of standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), i.e., Stupp protocol, which involves surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma remains refractory to treatment and recurrence is inevitable. Moreover, the biology of recurrent glioblastoma remains unclear. Increasing evidence has shown that intratumoral heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment contribute to therapeutic resistance. However, the interaction between intracellular heterogeneity and drug resistance in recurrent GBMs remains controversial. The aim of this study was to map the transcriptome landscape of cancer cells and the tumor heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment in recurrent and drug-resistant GBMs at a single-cell resolution and further explore the mechanism of drug resistance of GBMs. We analyzed six tumor tissue samples from three patients with primary GBM and three patients with recurrent GBM in which recurrence and drug resistance developed after treatment with the standard Stupp protocol using single-cell RNA sequencing. Using unbiased clustering, nine major cell clusters were identified. Upregulation of the expression of stemness-related and cell-cycle-related genes was observed in recurrent GBM cells. Compared with the initial GBM tissues, recurrent GBM tissues showed a decreased proportion of microglia, consistent with previous reports. Finally, vascular endothelial growth factor A expression and the blood-brain barrier permeability were high, and the O6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase-related signaling pathway was activated in recurrent GBM. Our results delineate the single-cell map of recurrent glioblastoma, tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment, and drug-resistance mechanisms, providing new insights into treatment strategies for recurrent glioblastomas."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"36853018\": [{\"drug_name\": null, \"direct_target\": null, \"drug-direct_target_interaction\": null, \"clinical_trials_id\": null}]}"}]}
